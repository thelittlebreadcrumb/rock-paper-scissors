## The Odin Project - Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Frankly speaking, this project was *not easy*. At least not for me. Being new to programming, I've not yet figured out what  the best is way to conceptualize the game logic. Using the HTML insertion syntax was not something that was often taught in any of the excercises, it was passive via W3School's TryIt Editors. 

**In The Odin Project's defense**: The game was to be run only in the javascript console. Seeing the multitudes of solutions being a GUI instead, made me believe that its the best way to approach this.

In effort to help anyone else along the way, I've done some heavy commenting on my script file. Check [app.js](app.js) where I describe how the code works. I'm immensely thankful for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqy8Ov3NWvQ). It's helped me understand fundamentals better than anything else.

So, in short, there's so much to learn ahead but The Odin Project's rare assignments are not enough to test your learning. I'll get there, slowly but surely. I'm sure of it :)
