## The Odin Project - Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Frankly speaking, this project was *not easy*. At least not for me. Being new to programming, I've not yet figured out what is the best way to conceptualize the game logic. Even after I'd worked this out, using the syntax was not something that was often used in any of the excercises. W3School's TryIt Editors were the only place that I actually saw HTML insertion being used.

**In The Odin Project's defense**: The game was to be run only in the javascript console. Seeing the multitudes of solutions being a GUI instead, made me believe that its the best way to approach this.

In effort to help anyone else along the way, I've done some heavy commenting on my script file. Check [app.js](app.js) where I describe how the code works. I'm immensely thankful for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqy8Ov3NWvQ&t=873s). It's helped me understand fundamentals better than anything else.


So, in short, there's so much to learn ahead but The Odin Project's rare assignments are not enough to test your learning. I'll get there, slowly but surely. I'm sure of it :)
